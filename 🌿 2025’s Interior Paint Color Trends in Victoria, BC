Victoria homeowners, assemble! Inspired by our 2024 color trends post, it’s time to refresh your space with 2025’s most exciting palettes. This year embraces natural stories, bold accents, and newfound comfort—perfect for Victoria’s West Coast charm.
1. Color‑Infused Neutrals
Say goodbye to stark grays and beige—2025 neutrals come with subtle color undertones like blush, mint, sage, butter, and peach. These modern alternatives deliver warmth with character, acting as perfect cocooning backdrops that remain easy to layer.
2. Warm Earth & Cozy Browns
This year, warm browns replace their cool, muted predecessors. Think soft caramel, cinnamon, and terracotta—rich yet inviting tones showcased by names like “Rumors” from Behr and caramel hues in Dakota Johnson’s cozy living room palette. These hues add depth without overwhelming, tying beautifully to Victoria’s earthy, natural interiors.
3. Mood‑Shifting Greens
Green continues its reign in 2025—but today's greens are softer, mysterious, and nature-inspired. Pistachio green is trending in cozy bedroom retreats, while deeper “green‑blue” tones create serene, organic spaces. Brands like Farrow & Ball and Behr offer leafy, grounding hues that pair beautifully with Victoria’s abundant greenery.
4. Bolder Blues & Jewel Tones
If deep, rich tones call out to you, look to dramatic blues and jewel-like accents. Expect saturated ultramarines from Valspar, deep sapphires, burgundies, and richer reds making bold statements in 2025. These intense hues are ideal for accent walls and Moorish-inspired living rooms that pop.
5. Muted Pinks & Soft Lavender
Soothing, mature pinks and lavenders are making a comeback—think rose‑dust or dusty mauve in bedrooms or reading nooks. These tones bring gentle romance without feeling trendy or youthful. Sherwin‑Williams even included “Mauve Finery” in its 2025 color capsule.
6. Cheerful Yellows & Sunny Golds
Sunny yellow tones like Sherwin-Williams’ Bosc Pear and Dulux’s “True Joy™” yellow encourage brightness in homes—even on gloomy Vancouver Island days. These cheerful shades are perfect as accent walls in kitchens or entryways.
