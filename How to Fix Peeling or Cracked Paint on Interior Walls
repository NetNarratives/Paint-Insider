Nothing ruins the look of a room faster than peeling or cracked paint on interior walls. These imperfections not only make the space look unkempt but can also indicate underlying issues like moisture problems or poor surface preparation. Fortunately, fixing peeling or cracked paint is a straightforward process that requires just a few tools and some patience. 
Follow these steps to restore your walls to a smooth, flawless finish.

Step 1: Identify the Cause
Before jumping into repairs, it's important to determine why the paint is peeling or cracking in the first place. Common causes include:
Moisture: High humidity or water leaks can cause paint to lose adhesion.
Poor Surface Preparation: If the wall wasn't cleaned or primed properly before painting, the paint may not have bonded well.
Aging Paint: Over time, paint naturally deteriorates and may start to crack or peel.
Using Incompatible Paints: Painting over oil-based paint with latex paint without proper priming can lead to peeling.
Step 2: Gather Your Materials
You’ll need the following tools and materials:
Putty knife or paint scraper
Sandpaper (120 to 220 grit)
Spackle or patching compound
Paint primer (preferably a stain-blocking or bonding primer)
Paintbrush and roller
Paint (same color as existing or new choice)
Clean cloth or sponge
Painter’s tape (optional)
Step 3: Remove Loose or Damaged Paint
Use a putty knife or paint scraper to gently remove any loose or flaking paint. Be careful not to damage the wall surface underneath. If the affected area is extensive, consider using a paint-stripping solution.

Step 4: Sand the Area
After scraping, sand the edges of the affected area to create a smooth transition between the damaged and intact paint. This will help the new paint blend seamlessly with the existing surface. Wipe away dust with a damp cloth or sponge before moving on to the next step.

Step 5: Repair the Surface
For small cracks or holes, use spackle or a patching compound to fill in the imperfections. Apply a thin layer with a putty knife, let it dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then sand it smooth. If the damage is extensive, you may need to use a joint compound and mesh tape for additional support.

Step 6: Apply a Quality Primer
A good primer ensures that the repaired area blends well with the rest of the wall and improves paint adhesion. Use a stain-blocking or bonding primer, especially if moisture was the culprit behind the peeling paint. Let the primer dry completely before painting.

Step 7: Repaint the Wall
Once the primer is dry, apply a fresh coat of paint using a brush for small areas and a roller for larger sections. Allow the first coat to dry completely before adding a second coat for better coverage and durability.

Prevent Future Paint Peeling or Cracking
To avoid dealing with peeling or cracked paint again, follow these preventive measures:
Control Moisture: Use a dehumidifier or fix any water leaks to prevent excess moisture from damaging your walls.
Prep Properly: Always clean and prime surfaces before painting.
Choose High-Quality Paint: Invest in durable, high-quality paint suitable for the room’s conditions.
Apply Paint Correctly: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for drying times between coats to ensure proper adhesion.
