When it comes to refreshing your home, few projects are as satisfying as painting a room.

Why Paint Your Bathroom?
Bathrooms are high-traffic areas that can show wear and tear quickly. A fresh coat of paint not only rejuvenates the space but also protects the walls from moisture and mildew. Painting your bathroom can also be an affordable way to modernize it without a full renovation.
Key Steps to DIY Bathroom Painting
1. Choose the Right Paint
Opt for moisture-resistant, mildew-resistant paints specifically designed for bathrooms.
Select a semi-gloss or satin finish for durability and ease of cleaning.
2. Prepare the Space
Remove all fixtures, mirrors, and towel racks.
Clean the walls thoroughly to remove soap scum, dirt, and grease.
Patch any holes or imperfections with spackle and sand them smooth.
3. Tape and Protect
Use painter's tape to cover edges, trim, and fixtures you can’t remove.
Lay down drop cloths to protect the floor and other surfaces.
4. Prime the Walls
If your bathroom walls have stains or are a darker color, use a quality primer to ensure a smooth, even finish.
5. Apply the Paint
Start with cutting in the edges using a brush.
Use a roller for larger areas, applying paint in a "W" pattern for even coverage.
Allow the first coat to dry completely before applying a second coat.
6. Finishing Touches
Once the paint is dry, remove the painter's tape and reattach fixtures.
Clean up any drips or smudges with a damp cloth.
Pro Tips for a Professional Finish
Ventilate the room well to reduce drying time and minimize paint fumes.
Use high-quality brushes and rollers to avoid streaks and lint.
Consider adding an accent wall for a stylish touch.
