Is your kitchen looking a little tired, even though everything still works just fine? A fresh coat of paint on your cabinets can completely transform the space—no need for a full renovation. Whether you're a DIY warrior or someone thinking about hiring a pro, this step-by-step guide will help you understand the process and what goes into a stunning cabinet refresh.

Step 1: Remove Cabinet Doors and Hardware
Start by taking off all cabinet doors, drawers, and hardware (hinges, knobs, pulls). Label everything so you’ll know where it goes later. This small step will save you big headaches during reassembly!

Pro Tip: Store screws and hardware in labeled ziplock bags.

Step 2: Clean and Degrease
Kitchen cabinets deal with a lot of grease, steam, and food residue. Use a degreasing cleaner (like TSP or dish soap and warm water) to thoroughly wipe down all surfaces. Let them dry completely before moving on.

Step 3: Sand the Surfaces
Sanding is crucial for paint to stick. Lightly sand all cabinet surfaces using 120- to 150-grit sandpaper. You don’t need to remove the old finish—just rough it up enough for the primer to grip.

Pro Tip: Use a sanding block or orbital sander for faster results.

Step 4: Apply Primer
Primer helps paint stick and prevents stains from bleeding through. Use a high-quality bonding primer and apply it evenly with a brush or roller. Let it dry completely—usually overnight—for best results.

Step 5: Paint Your Cabinets
Now for the fun part! Choose a durable cabinet paint (latex or oil-based). Use a brush for corners and details, and a foam roller for large flat surfaces. Apply two thin coats instead of one thick one, allowing proper drying time between coats.

Popular colors? White, soft gray, navy, and even forest green are trending for a modern but timeless look.

Step 6: Reassemble and Admire
Once everything is dry and cured (usually 2–3 days), reattach the doors, drawers, and hardware. You can also use this opportunity to upgrade to new knobs or handles for a totally refreshed look.
