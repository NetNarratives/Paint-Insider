So, you’ve just finished painting a room, and it looks amazing—but now you’re stuck with that strong, lingering paint smell. Yikes! While fresh paint can completely transform a space, the fumes can be overwhelming and even a little headache-inducing.
Luckily, you don’t have to suffer for days waiting for the smell to fade. There are plenty of easy and effective ways to get rid of paint odors fast. Whether you’re dealing with a newly painted bedroom, a fresh coat on furniture, or a full house makeover, here are the best tricks to clear the air and enjoy your new space—without the stink.

1. Ventilation Is Key
This might seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how many people forget this simple step. Open all windows and doors to create cross-ventilation. If possible, place a fan near the window to help push the fumes outside. Letting fresh air circulate is one of the fastest ways to dissipate that strong paint smell.
Pro tip: If you have a box fan, set it facing outward in a window to pull the paint fumes outside.

2. Use Baking Soda
Baking soda is a natural odor absorber, and it works wonders on paint smells. Here’s what you can do:
Pour some baking soda into small bowls and place them around the painted room.
Leave them overnight to absorb the odor.
Vacuum up any baking soda that may have settled onto floors or furniture.
Bonus: If your carpet has absorbed the paint smell, sprinkle baking soda over it, let it sit for a few hours, then vacuum it up.

3. Try Activated Charcoal
Activated charcoal is like a supercharged version of baking soda when it comes to absorbing odors. You can find it in pet stores, home improvement stores, or online.
Place a few bowls of activated charcoal around the room.
Let them sit for at least a day.
Replace if necessary for persistent odors.
It’s a simple but powerful trick that professional painters swear by!

4. Coffee Grounds to the Rescue
If you love the smell of coffee, this one’s for you! Coffee grounds can neutralize odors while leaving behind a pleasant, rich scent.
Fill a few bowls with dry coffee grounds and set them around the room.
Stir them occasionally to release more of their odor-absorbing power.
Bonus: If you’re a coffee lover, your room will smell like your favorite café!

5. Onions—Yes, Onions!
This one sounds weird, but it works surprisingly well. Onions contain compounds that neutralize paint fumes.
Slice an onion in half.
Place each half in a bowl of water, cut side up.
Leave them in the painted room overnight.
The onion will absorb the fumes, but be warned—it might leave behind its own smell! Luckily, onion odors fade much faster than paint fumes.

6. White Vinegar for the Win
Vinegar is another natural odor eliminator. Its strong scent may not be for everyone, but it’s great at neutralizing paint fumes.
Pour white vinegar into bowls and place them around the room.
Let them sit overnight.
If the vinegar smell lingers, just air out the room for a bit.
Pro tip: Apple cider vinegar works too, and its scent is a little milder!

7. Candles and Essential Oils
Scented candles and essential oils don’t just mask the smell—they can actually help break down the paint fumes.
Light a few candles and let them burn for a couple of hours.
Use a diffuser with essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus, or lemon.
Add a few drops of essential oil to a bowl of water and let it sit in the room.
This method not only removes odors but also makes your space smell amazing.

8. Keep Bowls of Water Around
One of the easiest tricks is to simply leave out bowls of water. Water absorbs airborne particles, including paint fumes.
For an extra boost, add lemon slices or a few drops of essential oil to the water. Let the bowls sit overnight, and you’ll notice a big difference by morning.

9. Use Air Purifiers
If you have an air purifier, now is the time to use it! Air purifiers with activated carbon filters are especially effective at removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from paint fumes.
If you don’t own one, consider investing in a small, portable purifier—it’ll come in handy for future painting projects (and even just for cleaner indoor air in general).

10. Choose Low-VOC or No-VOC Paint Next Time
Okay, this won’t help you right now, but it’s a great tip for future painting projects. Low-VOC (volatile organic compounds) and no-VOC paints are designed to have little to no smell. They’re better for your health and the environment. Brands like Behr, Sherwin-Williams, and Benjamin Moore all offer low-VOC options.
If you plan to paint again, choosing these paints can save you the hassle of dealing with strong fumes in the first place!

Final Thoughts
Getting rid of paint smells doesn’t have to be a long, painful process. With a few household items and some good airflow, you can clear the air in no time. Whether you opt for baking soda, onions, coffee, or candles, these methods will help you enjoy your freshly painted space without the lingering odor.
So go ahead—breathe easy and admire your work! Have you tried any of these tricks before? Let me know what worked best for you! 🚀🎨
