You’ve picked the perfect color. You’re ready to transform your space. But wait—what about the sheen? That subtle detail can make a big difference in how your paint looks, lasts, and even feels.
Whether you're updating a single room or planning a full home makeover, choosing the right paint sheen is just as important as the color. The sheen affects not only how light reflects off your walls, but also how well they hold up to fingerprints, scrapes, and everyday wear.
Let’s break it down.
Matte: The Soft, Subtle Classic
Best for: Bedrooms, ceilings, adult spaces with low traffic
Matte (or flat) finishes have no shine. They give walls a soft, velvety look that hides imperfections beautifully. If your walls have bumps, cracks, or patchwork, matte is your best friend.
But beware: Matte is not very wipeable. It can scuff easily and may absorb stains. That makes it less ideal for kids’ rooms or high-traffic areas—unless you’re okay with doing a few touch-ups now and then.
Eggshell: The Balanced Beauty
Best for: Living rooms, dining areas, home offices
Eggshell offers a low-sheen finish—just enough to reflect a bit of light and create depth. It’s more durable than matte but still soft enough to feel cozy. Think of it as the “best of both worlds.”
This is a go-to for many homeowners who want a classic look without giving up easy cleaning.
Satin: The Smooth Operator
Best for: Hallways, kids’ rooms, kitchens, bathrooms
Satin has a slight sheen—almost like a pearl glow. It’s super versatile and durable, making it a great choice for busy spaces. It holds up well to cleaning and resists moisture better than lower sheens.
If you have children, pets, or just a lot of life happening in your home, satin gives you the polish and performance you need.
Semigloss: The Shine That Works
Best for: Trim, doors, cabinets, and moisture-prone areas
Semigloss reflects quite a bit of light. It’s smooth, sleek, and very easy to wipe clean. Because of its shine, it draws attention—so use it where you want details to pop, like on baseboards, molding, or bathroom walls.
Keep in mind that semigloss can highlight imperfections, so surface prep is key.
