When it comes to home design, your walls can make a statement, whether you realize it or not. The trend of textured walls—think popcorn ceilings, knockdown finishes, and the like—has been a fixture in many homes for decades. But as home trends shift, one question keeps popping up: should you keep your textured walls, or is it time to smooth them out?
Let’s dive into both sides of the debate and help you decide what’s best for your space.
The Case for Keeping Textured Walls
Character and Charm:Textured walls can add some personality to a room. They can create a cozy, rustic, or even vintage vibe, depending on the style. Popcorn ceilings? Sure, they might scream “1980s,” but in the right setting, they can evoke a nostalgic charm. A knockdown texture might bring a bit of visual interest without being too over-the-top. If you love a lived-in, eclectic style, keeping your textured walls might suit your aesthetic.
Concealing Imperfections:One of the main benefits of textured walls is their ability to hide imperfections. Dings, scratches, and uneven surfaces become much less noticeable when you’ve got some texture on your walls. If your walls have seen better days (or if you’re just not into the idea of perfection), this can be a game-changer. Textures like stucco or a simple brushstroke design can hide all the little flaws that would otherwise require hours of patching and smoothing.
A DIY-Friendly Option:If you’re on a budget or just like to dive into DIY projects, textured walls can be an easy way to add some depth and flair without breaking the bank. Whether you’re doing it yourself or hiring someone to do it, adding texture is generally less expensive than smoothing out walls, especially if the walls are already textured.
The Case for Smoothing Them Out
Modern and Sleek Look:In today’s design world, smooth walls are often associated with a clean, modern look. If you’re after that fresh, minimalistic vibe, then smooth, flawless walls are your best bet. Smooth surfaces allow the light to bounce off evenly, making the room feel more expansive and open. If you’re planning to sell your home anytime soon, keeping your walls smooth could be a good idea, as it’s currently the more market-friendly option.
Easier to Maintain:While textured walls may hide imperfections, they can also make them harder to clean. Dust, cobwebs, and grime can cling to the crevices, making regular cleaning a bit more challenging. Smoothing out your walls can make it much easier to wipe down surfaces and keep everything looking crisp and fresh. It’s a low-maintenance choice, especially if you have kids or pets running around.
A Blank Canvas for New Decor:Smooth walls give you the freedom to experiment with different paint finishes, wallpaper, and artwork. Whether you’re drawn to bold colors, dramatic murals, or sleek metallic finishes, smooth walls provide a perfect backdrop for your creative ideas. Textured walls can be a bit more limiting in terms of design flexibility, but with a smooth surface, you can take your space in any direction you desire.
The Compromise: A Happy Medium
If you love the texture but aren’t so keen on the upkeep, why not opt for something in between? There are plenty of subtle textures—like Venetian plaster or even a soft, hand-troweled look—that add depth without overwhelming the space. These options can give you that chic, custom look without the full-on commitment to a bumpy or textured surface.
What’s the Verdict?
Ultimately, the decision to keep or smooth out your walls boils down to personal style, maintenance, and long-term goals. If you’re leaning toward a more classic or rustic style, textured walls might be your jam. On the other hand, if you’re after a clean, modern aesthetic, smoothing them out could make all the difference.
Before you make any decisions, take a step back and consider the mood you want to create in your home and how much time (and money) you’re willing to invest. Whether you’re into the charm of textured walls or prefer the sleekness of a smooth finish, there’s no right or wrong—just what works best for you and your space.
